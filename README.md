# Pharmacokinetic Modelling Group Project

A PharmacoKinetic (PK) modelling function for analysis of injected solute dynamics over time, developed by Group 8 of the 2021 Software Engineering course. This model has been developed with the end-user in mind, and includes an easy-to-use interface to guide refinement of tissue models.

# Background
Ref: https://sabs-r3.github.io/software-engineering-projects/01-introduction/index.html.

The field of Pharmacokinetics (PK) provides a quantitative basis for describing the delivery of a drug to a patient, the diffusion of that drug through the plasma/body tissue, and the subsequent clearance of the drug from the patientâ€™s system. PK is used to ensure that there is sufficient concentration of the drug to maintain the required efficacy of the drug, while ensuring that the concentration levels remain below the toxic threshold. Pharmacokinetic (PK) models are often combined with Pharmacodynamic (PD) models, which model the positive effects of the drug, such as the binding of a drug to the biological target, and/or undesirable side effects, to form a full PKPD model of the drug-body interaction. This project will only focus on PK, neglecting the interaction with a PD model.

# Model overview

Our model consists of three principal modules:
- A solver (solver.py) that computes the distribution of solute in different tissue compartments over time, given input parameters including the number of compartments to model, dose,  mode of administration  (intravenous or subcutaneous), compartment volume and transition rate constants.
- A user interface (ux.py) that prompts the user to configure the model
- A visualisation module (XXX.py) that generates and saves comparative plots to facilitate evaluation of PK using different administration methods.
